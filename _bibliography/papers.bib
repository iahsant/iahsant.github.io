  title={NARX Modeling and Simulation of Heave Dynamics with Application of Robust Control of an Underactuated Underwater Vehicle},
  author={Ahmad, Sarvat Mushtaq and Tanveer, Ahsan},
  abstract={This article, which is an extension of the previous work of the authors (Tanveer and Ahmad (2022)) on yaw dynamics, investigates the modeling and control of heave degree-of-freedom of a compact custom designed ROV. Wherein, nonlinear data-driven modeling strategy is adopted to develop a high-fidelity heave dynamic model. The proposed modeling approach uses open-loop real-time experimental data to derive a high-fidelity NARX model of the vehicle. The resulting model accommodates the dynamics of the system in addition to the tether dynamics. The advantage of this approach is its ability to eliminate the need for intricate controller tuning. The identified model consistently demonstrated fitness scores ranging from 82% to 92% in both self-validation and cross-validation tests conducted on distinct datasets. This relative advantage is exemplified in real-time through the testing of a Genetic Algorithm Proportional-Integral (GAPI) controller. The performance of GAPI is subsequently compared with the relatively recent Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA) and the more conventional root-locus tuned PI controllers. The experimental results demonstrate that GAPI provides the most favorable response, achieving a 35%, 76%, and 44% improvement in rise time, percent overshoot and peak time, respectively. Furthermore, the controller effort required by GAPI running on an ATmega328 chipset is 22% less than its counterparts.

  title={Strength Improvement/Optimization Methods in Adhesively Bonded Joints: A Comprehensive Review of Past and Present Techniques},
  author={Ejaz, Hassan and Awan, M Awais and Muzzammil, HM and Ullah, Mateen and Akhavan-Safar, A and Dasilva, LFM and Tanveer, Ahsan},
  abstract={Adhesive bonding is a versatile joining method gaining popularity due to its ability to join variety of metals, nonmetals, and composite materials to achieve lightweight, high-strength structures. Unlike mechanical fasteners that require holes, adhesive bonding creates a continuous bond, resulting in a more uniform stress distribution. It also allows bonding thin materials and dissimilar materials, and creates airtight seals. However, even with these advantages, adhesive joints lack structural redundancy and sometimes strength compared to their mechanical counterparts. This has driven extensive research and development efforts to improve their strength, reliability, and overall performance. The present paper aims to explore both historical and recent advancements in techniques for enhancing the strength of adhesively bonded joints, organizing them in a coherent and systematic manner that can be easily quantified. The paper also presents a comprehensive comparison of the techniques, their dependency on various factors, and guidelines for the optimal choice. This examination could pave the way for novel optimization techniques and data-driven approaches for achieving superior joint performance.},

  author={Ejaz, Hassan and Mubashar, A and Tanveer, Ahsan and Uddin, Emad and Ali, Zaib and Arif, Nabeel},
  journal={Journal of Adhesion Science and Technology},
  abstract={In this research, a comprehensive comparison of the effects of adding nanomaterials on mechanical behavior of structural adhesive was experimentally investigated. The nanomaterials, namely graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs), and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) were introduced at varying weight fractions of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 wt% within the host adhesive. In addition to the parameters of type of nanomaterial and weight fraction, the effect of nanomaterial functionalization was also included. Two types of primary functionalization: carboxyl (COOH) and amine (NH2) along with non-functionalized filler was utilized. The nanomaterials were mixed in a high viscous structural adhesive araldite® 2011 by following a comprehensive mixing method. Flat doge bone specimens were prepared according to ASTM standard and subjected to testing using a universal testing machine (UTM). The results of the experimentation showed that the mechanical behavior of epoxy adhesive is significantly influenced by the addition of any type carbonaceous nanomaterial (GNPs, MWCNTs, and RGO) in the study, however, significant variation in mechanical properties (Elastic Modulus, Tensile Strength, Failure Strain, and Tensile Toughness), as well as their respective trends was observed among these nanomaterials. Overall, the introduction of GNPs was observed to increase the brittleness of the epoxy adhesive, whereas MWCNTs exhibited a contrasting effect by reducing brittleness. Moreover, it was found that the effect of functionalization and filler concentration on resulting properties was independent of each other.},

  title={Exploration of Fluidic Thrust Vectoring Control on a Dynamic Test Rig: Computational and Experimental Analysis},
  author={Tanveer, Ahsan and Ahmad, Sarvat Mushtaq},
  journal={Engineering Proceedings},
  abstract={Fluidic thrust vectoring (FTV) control is a cutting-edge method used to manipulate the motion of an unmanned air vehicle when traditional control surfaces like elevators are not available. The primary purpose of employing FTV is to make the aircraft less detectable. This research centers around the exploration of the co-flow variation of the FTV concept. In this approach, a secondary jet with a significant velocity is injected into the boundary layer of the primary jet. As a consequence, the primary jet is diverted, leading to the formation of a pitch moment. Numerical simulations were conducted to analyze different ratios of secondary and primary jet velocities, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The test rig, designed with a pitch-constraint dynamic setup, utilized electric ducted fans to generate primary and secondary flows. At 19 m/s primary velocity, the experimental testing shows a maximum vertical force of 0.4 N, producing a deflection of 25°, which is deemed adequate for thrust vectoring. This research builds upon the authors’ previous work on characterizing a static co-flow FTV rig. The comparison between the computational fluid dynamics analyses and the experimental results demonstrates agreement in the behavior of the vectored jet. This validation further strengthens the findings presented in this paper.},

  title={Cross-coupled Dynamics and MPA-optimized Robust MIMO Control for a Compact Unmanned Underwater Vehicle},
  author={Tanveer, Ahsan and Ahmad, Sarvat Mushtaq},
  journal={Journal of Marine Science and Engineering},
  abstract={A compact, 3-degrees-of-freedom (DoF), low-cost, remotely operated unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), or MicroROV, is custom-designed, developed, instrumented, and interfaced with a PC for real-time data acquisition and control. The nonlinear equations of motion (EoM) are developed for the under-actuated, open-frame, cross-coupled MicroROV utilizing the Newton-Euler approach. The cross-coupling between heave and yaw motion, an important dynamic of a class of compact ROVs that is barely reported, is investigated here. This work is thus motivated towards developing an understanding of the physics of the highly coupled compact ROV and towards developing model-based stabilizing controllers. The linearized EoM aids in developing high-fidelity experimental data-driven transfer function models. The coupled heave-yaw transfer function model is improved to an auto-regressive moving average with exogenous input (ARMAX) model structure. The acquired models facilitate the use of the multi-parameter root-locus (MPRL) technique to design baseline controllers for a cross-coupled multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) MicroROV. The controller gains are further optimized by employing an innovative Marine Predator Algorithm (MPA). The robustness of the designed controllers is gauged using gain and phase margins. In addition, the real-time controllers were deployed on an onboard embedded system utilizing Simulink′s automatic C++ code generation capabilities. Finally, pool tests of the MicroROV demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control strategy.

  title={Mathematical Modelling and Fluidic Thrust Vectoring Control of a Delta Wing UAV},
  author={Tanveer, Ahsan and Ahmad, Sarvat Mushtaq},
  abstract={Pitch control of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using fluidic thrust vectoring (FTV) is a relatively novel technique requiring no moving control surfaces, such as elevators. In this paper, the authors’ previous work on the characterization of a static co-flow FTV rig is further validated using the free to pitch dynamic test bench. The deflection of a primary jet after injection of a high-velocity secondary jet was captured using the tuft flow visualization technique, along with the experimental recording of subsequent normal force impinged on the Coanda surface resulting in the pitching moment. The effect of primary and secondary flow velocities on exhaust jet deflection, as well as on the pitch angle of the aircraft, is examined. Aerodynamic gain as well as the inertia of a delta wing UAV test bench are computed through experiments and fed into the equation of motion (e.o.m). The e.o.m developed aided in the design of a model-based PID controller for pitch motion control using the multi-parameter root locus technique. The root locus tuned controller serves as a benchmark controller for performance evaluation of the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) tuned controllers. Furthermore, the frequency domain metric of gain and phase margins were also employed to reach a robust control design. Experiments conducted in a simulation environment reveal that PSO-PID results in a better response of the UAV in comparison to the baseline pitch controller.

  abstract={In this paper, a custom built, underactuated, inspection class micro Remotely Operated Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (ROV) is employed as a testbed to investigate control and modelling problems related to underwater vehicles in shallow waters and pools. Dynamic model for yaw is obtained via mathematical modelling and system identification techniques. To instil confidence in the identified model, residuals and cross-validation tests are carried out to obtain high fidelity vehicle model for subsequent stabilizing closed-loop control design. Following the modelling exercise, design, real-time implementation, and analysis of a GA optimized PI controller for yaw is carried out. The performance of the GA optimized controller is benchmarked against the experimental results of a multi-parameter root-locus tuned PI controller and simulated responses of a standard linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller. In addition, the efficacy of the GA-PI controller is gauged employing recently developed marine predator algorithm (MPA). The need for a controller with optimized performance motivated the utilization of GA and MPA optimization techniques. The results from real-time pool experiments indicate substantially enhanced performance of GA optimized controller, outperforming other controllers by as much as 22% in performance indicators such as settling time and maximum overshoot. Furthermore, the GA optimized controller demonstrated far better robustness and disturbance rejection capabilities.
