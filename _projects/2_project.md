This project explored fluidic thrust vectoring (FTV) as an alternative to traditional mechanical control surfaces for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The work involved both mathematical modeling and computational/experimental validation of fluidic actuation strategies for controlling delta wing configurations.

Key contributions include:

1. Developing analytical and numerical models for FTV-based control of delta wing UAVs.
2. Designing and testing a dynamic experimental rig to validate flow control concepts.
3. Demonstrating that fluidic actuation can generate effective control forces, enabling enhanced maneuverability without the complexity of movable surfaces.

These studies highlighted the potential of FTV for next-generation UAVs, offering reduced mechanical complexity, stealth advantages, and adaptability in both conventional and unconventional flight regimes.
