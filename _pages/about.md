I am currently a doctoral student under Prof. <a href='https://amr.pku.edu.cn/jzyg/szdw/X/0dba539cb6214815a8b90e659d9eabef.htm'>Guangming Xie</a> at the School of Advanced Manufacturing and Robotics, Peking University. Previously, I was a lecturer at the <a href='https://www.au.edu.pk/pages/Faculties/IAA/Departments/MechanicalAerospace/FacultyDetail.aspx?fid=1545'>Institute of Avionics and Aeronautics (IAA)</a>, Air University, Islamabad. I obtained my master’s degree in mechanical engineering from the GIK Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology (GIKIEST), Swabi, in 2021. During my masters, I was affiliated with the Vibrational Dynamics and Controls (VDC) Lab, advised by Prof. Sarvat M. Ahmad. I received my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Engineering & Technology (UET), Peshawar, in 2019, advised by Prof. Mohammad A. Irfan. I have also worked at the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Pakistan, and at the Interdisciplinary Research Center for Intelligent Manufacturing and Robotics (IRC-IMR), King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Saudi Arabia.

My research lies at the intersection of bio-inspired robotics, applied controls, and machine learning, with a focus on soft and continuum systems in underwater environments. Broadly, I am interested in developing frameworks that combine modeling, intelligent control, and multimodal sensing to enable robust, adaptive, and efficient operation in challenging conditions.

Current and future directions of my work include:

1. Continuum robotic arm modeling and control for underwater manipulation and locomotion
2. Leveraging vision–language–action (VLA) models to enhance autonomy and decision-making in robotic systems
3. Electrosensory-inspired feedback for underwater localization and perception
4. Bio-inspired actuation mechanisms for untethered marine robots
5. Translating sensorimotor principles from real animals to robotic counterparts to achieve embodied intelligence
